### CPSC 120

* Lab 10
I enjoyed lab 10 because it was a good demonstration of a vector in a vector which would make a two dimensional data structure. In other words, this lab taught the idea of creating a table and then referring to that table in other programs. For example, in this particular lab, we had the name of the counties and their population, so something like ca_counties.at(1).at(1) would show the population of the first county (which is Alameda alphabetically) and its corresponding population of 1648556.

* Lab 11
I enjoyed lab 11 because it taught the concept of creating classes. I think I still have difficulty understanding this process as a whole, but I think the lab made some of the concepts clear. Overall, this lab was challenging which is why I enjoyed it and forced me to think critically.

* Lab 12
I enjoyed lab 12 because it felt like an accumulation of everything that was taught throughout the semester in a single lab. The concept of using a sin function and referring to its values across pi made sense, intuitively to me. Seeing the entire project come together and print out the images that were asked of us felt like a major accomplishment.
